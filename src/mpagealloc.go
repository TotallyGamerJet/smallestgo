	// The total size of chunks is quite large on most 64-bit platforms
	// (O(GiB) or more) if flattened, so rather than making one large mapping
	// (which has problems on some platforms, even when PROT_NONE) we use a
	// two-level sparse array approach similar to the arena index in mheap.
	//
	// To find the chunk containing a memory address `a`, do:
	//   chunkOf(chunkIndex(a))

	// heapAddrBits supported by the runtime.

	// heapAddrBits | L1 Bits | L2 Bits | L2 Entry Size
	// ------------------------------------------------
	// 32           | 0       | 10      | 128 KiB
	// 33 (iOS)     | 0       | 11      | 256 KiB
	// 48           | 13      | 13      | 1 MiB

	// There's no reason to use the L1 part of chunks on 32-bit, the
	// address space is small so the L2 is small. For platforms with a
	// 48-bit address space, we pick the L1 such that the L2 is 1 MiB
