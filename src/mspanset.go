	// A spanSet is a two-level data structure consisting of a
	// growable spine that points to fixed-sized blocks. The spine
	// can be accessed without locks, but adding a block or
	// growing it requires taking the spine lock.
	//
	// Because each mspan covers at least 8K of heap and takes at
	// most 8 bytes in the spanSet, the growth of the spine is
	// quite limited.
	//
	// The spine and all blocks are allocated off-heap, which
	// allows this to be used in the memory manager and avoids the
	// need for write barriers on all of these. spanSetBlocks are
	// managed in a pool, though never freed back to the operating
	// system. We never release spine memory because there could be
	// concurrent lock-free access and we're likely to reuse it
	// anyway. (In principle, we could do this during STW.)

	spineLen  atomic.Uintptr            // Spine array length
	spineCap  uintptr                   // Spine array cap, accessed under spineLock

	// index is the head and tail of the spanSet in a single field.
	// The head and the tail both represent an index into the logical
	// concatenation of all blocks, with the head always behind or
	// equal to the tail (indicating an empty set). This field is
	// always accessed atomically.
	//
	// The head and the tail are only 32 bits wide, which means we
	// can only support up to 2^32 pushes before a reset. If every
	// span in the heap were stored in this set, and each span were
	// the minimum size (1 runtime page, 8 KiB), then roughly the
	// smallest heap which would be unrepresentable is 32 TiB in size.
